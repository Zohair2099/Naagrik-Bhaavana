    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to optimize for security, scalability, and query performance, adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Structural Segregation, and Access Modeling. We leverage path-based ownership for user-generated content and denormalization to avoid `get()` calls in security rules.\n\n1.  **Issue Reports:** Issue reports are stored under `/users/{userId}/issueReports/{issueReportId}`. This path-based ownership ensures that only the user can create, read, update, and delete their own reports.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** No `get()` calls are needed in the security rules because the `userId` is embedded in the document path.\n\n**QAPs Support:** The structure is designed to enable secure `list` operations. Users can only list issue reports under their own user ID, while admins (if implemented) could have separate collections or mechanisms for broader access (not detailed here, but could involve a global roles collection).\n\n2.  **Users:** User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection.  This collection stores user-related information. Access is restricted to the user and, potentially, administrative roles (not detailed here, but could involve a global roles collection).\n\n**Authorization Independence:** User documents are accessed directly by their `userId`, eliminating the need to fetch parent documents for authorization.\n\n**QAPs Support:** List operations are restricted, ensuring that only the current user (or an admin) can access user documents."
